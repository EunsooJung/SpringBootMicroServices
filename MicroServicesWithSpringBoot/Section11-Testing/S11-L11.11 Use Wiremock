Section 11: Testing Microservices
 Lecture 11.11 Use Wiremock
   - Simulate a real server
   - To use it, you add the Wiremock stand alone dependency
     and then you can add a JUnit Wiremock rule.
* Using Wiremock
  * Mock HTTP interactions using a "real" server
  * Alternative to MockRestServiceServer
  * Can be used without RestTemplate
  * Add 'wiremock-standalone' dependency
  * Use WireMockRule
  * Define stubs
    this.wireMock.stubFor(
      get(urlEqualTo("/vehicle/" + VIN + "/details"))
      .willReturn(aResponse().withStatus(404)));
