 Lecture 11.10 Understand "slice" annotations
 
* Understanding "slice" annotations
  * All slice annotations are composed as follows:
    * Usually @OverrideAutoConfiguration
      - It one or more Type Exclude Filters, possibly one or more Auto Configure annotations
        and perhaps Property Mapping annotations.
    * Some @TypeExcludeFilters
    * One or more @AutoConfigure annotations
    * Possibly a @PropertyMapping annotation
  * @TypeExcludeFilters
    * Filters beans that are included via component scanning
    * Works with TypeExcludeFilter
    * Very important when @SpringBootApplication is used
  * @AutoConfigure...
    * Specific auto-configuration imports
    * Meta-annotated with @ImportAutoConfiguration
    * Load configuration classes via spring.factories
  * @PropertyMapping
    * Often used on @AutoConfigure...annotations
    * Map annotation attributes to Environment properties
    * Allows test configuration classes to use @Conditions
  
* Summary
  * You can build your own *Test annotations
  * You can override defaults
    * @DataJpaTest + @AutoConfigureTestDataBase(replace=NONE)
  * You can use @AutoConfigure annotation directly
