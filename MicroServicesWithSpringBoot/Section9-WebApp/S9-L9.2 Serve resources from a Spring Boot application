 Lecture 9.2 Serve resources from a Spring Boot application

* Serving Resources
  * You can serve static resources from your JAR
    * In src/main/resources/[resources, public, static]
    * From a nested JAR
    * From a WebJar (www.webjars.org)
  * You can add a custom favicon.ico

* Using JavaScript Build Tools
  * It doesn't matter how your resources get into your JAR
