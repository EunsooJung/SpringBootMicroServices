Section 9: Developing Web Applications
 Lecture 9.2.1 AngularJS

* Introduction
  * Takes a popular TODO tutorial and serves it from Spring Boot.
  * https://scotch.io/tutorials/creating-a-single-page-todo-app-with-node-and-angular

* Building and running the sample
  * Use the following commands to build run the application:

    $ mvn clean package
    $ java -jar target/livelessons-web-resources-angular-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

* Understanding the code
  * Angular and Bootstrap are served from WebJars and the application JavaScript 
    source is contained in src/main/resources/static.
  * This example also shows how you can call a rest service from Angular. 
    This is fairly typical in a microservice where the rich web application calls a 
    REST edge service which ultimately coordinates different microservices. 
    In this example we just call a dummy endpoint which has been mocked up 
    in the ToDoController class.
