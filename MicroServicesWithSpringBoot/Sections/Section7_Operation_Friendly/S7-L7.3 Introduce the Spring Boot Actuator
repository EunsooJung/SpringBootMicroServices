Section 7: Create Operation-Friendly Microservices
### Lecture 7.3.1 Introduce the Spring Boot Actuator (Extending Actuator)

* Introduction
  * Demonstrates how you can add your own actuator endpoints.

* Explain the Code
  * The WeatherEndpoint shows how you can easily add actuator endpoints by writing a bean that 
    implements the Endpoint interface (in this case by extending AbstractEndpoint). 
    You can access in the same way as the standard ones (HTTP, SSH, JMX).

  * The WeatherMvcEndpoint shows how you can also write specific extensions to be used 
    when the endpoint is accessed over HTTP. In this case we are adding a content type support. 
    If you open http://localhost:8080/weather in a browser you will see red text, 
    if you use curl you donâ€™t see any HTML markup.
