 Lecture 4.5: Evolve your database using Flyway
 
 * Data Migration
   * Microservices need to evolve, that means databases need to evolve
   * Automated repeatable migrations are required
   * Multiple environments are common (dev, staging, production)
 
 * Out of the Box Migration Support
   * Spring Boot supports:
     * Liquibase
     * Flyway
   * Both work in similar way
     * Add a tracking table to record the active version
     * Apply upgrade scripts as needed
