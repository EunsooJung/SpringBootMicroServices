  * Understanding the code

    * This is exactly the same code as the JPA example, except we have an additional spring-boot-starter-data-rest dependency. 
      The CarRepository also includes a couple of new annotations. 
      The @RestResource(path="find") provides a nicer name for the search URL and @Param("make") is used to indicate the name of the query parameter.
    * Once running you can open a browser to http://localhost:8080/cars to navigate the elements. 
      To perform a search you can use URLs in the form http://localhost:8080/cars/search/find?make=honda.
