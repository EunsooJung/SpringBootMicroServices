   * Store, retrieve and query JSON-like documents
   * One of the more popular NoSQL technologies

   * The same domain to the JPA sample is used with this demo. 
   * Rather than being a @Entity the Car here is a @Document. 
   * It has also been updated with a position (the geo-location where the car is stored).

   * The CarRepository works in the same way as any Spring Data repository and has the familiar findByMakeIgnoringCase method. The demo also includes a findByPositionNear method which shows how you can use MongoDB’s geo features.

   * The DataMongoDBApplication show how queries are executed and how you can also use MongoDB’s GridFS to store blob data.
 
 * How to install MongoDB on Mac ?
