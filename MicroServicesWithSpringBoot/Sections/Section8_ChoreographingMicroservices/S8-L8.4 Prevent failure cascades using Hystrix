 Lecture 8.4 Prevent failure cascades using Hystrix

* Circuit Breaker (noun: an automatic device for stopping the flow of current in an 
                         electric circuit  as a safety measure) pattern
  * Isolate service failure with a basic state machine around (by definition risky)
    service-to-service communication
  * Also called a bulk head
  * Hystrix is easy to plug in and easy to monitor


* Implements Hystrix
  * 1. pom.xml
  * 2. create configuration file (application.yml and bootstrap.yml)into the /resources
  *
