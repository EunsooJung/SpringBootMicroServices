 Lecture 5.8: Use Differential Synchronization and JSON PATCH

* JSON PATCH with Spring Sync
  * Differential Synchronization lets two nodes reconcile view of data
  * Spring Sync supports differential synchronization through a 
    DiffSyncController & JSON PATCH
  * When applying DS, each node maintains two copies of a resource:
    * The local node's own working copy that it may change.
    * A shadow copy which is the local node's understanding of what a remote
      node's working copy looks like.
    * Upon receiving a patch, a node must apply the patch to the shadow that it
      keeps for the node that sent the patch and to its own local copy (which may
      have had changes itself)
  * As it handles PATCH requests, DiffSyncController will apply one cycle of the 
    DS flow:
    * It will apply the patch to the server copy of the resource and to the shadow
      copy for the client who sent the PATCH.
    * It will create a new patch by comparing its local resource with the shadow copy.
    * It will replace the shadow copy with the local copy of the resource.
    * It will send the new patch on the response to the client.
