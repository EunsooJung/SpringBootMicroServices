Section 5: Giving your Microservice a REST
 Lecture 5.4: UnderStand HTTP Clients

* REST Maturity Model
  * The Richardson Maturity Model is a way to grade your API
    according to the REST constraints with 4 levels of increasing
    compliance
  * Richardson Maturity Model
    * Level 0: Swamp of POX
      * Uses HTTP mainly as a tunnel through one URI
        - e.g., SOAP, XML-RPC
      * Usually features on HTTP verb (POST)
    * Level 1: Resources
      * Multiple URIs to distinguish related nouns
      * e.g./articles/1, /articles/2 vs just / articles
    * Level 2: HTTP verbs
      * Leverage transport-native properties to enhance service
        e.g., HTTP GET and PUT and DELETE and POST
      * Uses idiomatic HTTP control like status codes and headers
      * Spring MVC, AJAX
    * Level 3: Hypermedia Controls (aka HATEOAS)
      * No a prior knowledge of service required
        Navigation options are provided by service and
        hypermedia controls
      * Promotes longevity through a uniform interface
        * Links
          * Links provide possible navigations from a given resource
          * Links are dynamic, based on resource state
            - <link href="http://...:8080/users/232/customers" rel="customers"/>
            - { href: "http://...:8080/users/232/customers" rel="customers" }
